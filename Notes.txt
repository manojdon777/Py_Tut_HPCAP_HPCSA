compiler based programs - c, c++ java
interpreted based program - Python , scripting langaue
Pyton - > compiler based, interpreted based, scripting langaue
	Everyhing in python is classes (OOPS)
	Python is not 100% OOPS baes prog lanaguages
Anything taken from K/B is always string
	String is said to be safest data type
	
	new line ("\n") is default in print of python -- end=
	space (" ") is default for multi arguments in print of python -- sep=

# 100 < 100 is always false
# 100 = 100	is true
# 100 <= 100	is true
# 100 >= 100	is true

Mutable and Immutable

Immutable = 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


Mutable -- you can find editable function
	Slow
	memroy high
	
Immutable -- you can't find editable function
	fast
	memory low
	
List
	empty
		list1 = []
		list2 = list()
	
Tuple
	empty
		tup1 = ()
		tup2 = tuple()
	
Set
	empty
		tup1 = set()
	dupliactes not allowed
		
Dictionary
	empty
		dict1 = {}
		dict2 = dict()		
		
		
string : Ordered,  Immutable, Duplicates are allowed
List   : Ordered,  Mutable,   Duplicates are allowed
Tuple  : Ordered,  Immuatble, Duplicates are allowed
Set    : Unorderd, Mutable,   Duplicates are not allowed
